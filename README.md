# Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics-Professional-Certificate
- Data portfolio projects I have done within the scope of Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate program, consisting of 6 end-of-course portfolio projects and 1 final capstone project that encompasses all the course content in a fictional case study. 
- For the projects of Courses 1-6, 3 different workplace scenarios for various companies (Automatidata, TikTok, Waze) were available as the main project theme, among which Waze was chosen for this portfolio. The capstone project is concerned with increasing the employee retention rate for Sailfort Motors, a fictional French alternative energy vehicle manufacturing company.
- The projects were done based on Google's PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) framework.
- All the Python code is in .ipynb format, while the executive summaries/presentations are in .pdf format and the provided datasets are in .csv format.

## Project Overview
- Waze leadership has asked your data team to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Wazeâ€™s business.
